# Roadmap

Features which fit the vision of the product, and have been requested by customers.

## Future improvements

Dashboard:
- The feed on the dashboard is probably not useful in the state it is now. Incomplete (e.g. regarding issue events). -> Use directly issue events to construct feed.
- TODOs should be attributable to someone.
- Refactor when example construction site is created: Only upon user request.

Register:
- Show number of events in issues as badge 
- Include events in the "Last activity" checkbox 
- Preview results in filter (preview expected number of results when applying new filter criteria)

Report:
- Add issue number coloring also to the table / to the photos

Edit:
- When adding an external construction manager, add context to the registration email about who did it, and for what construction site.

Resolve:
- show past protocol entries (filter by manual created entries)

Framework:
- Frontend often cannot recover from failed backend calls (e.g. button remains disabled)

Technical:
- [ ] IT translations could use a refactoring
