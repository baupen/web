# Sample data

Each sample has a specific purpose.

Simple is to be used as example for end users on how the app works.  
It should be small to download, nice to look at & fully configured.

Sun Park is the manual testing construction site, looking like a "real" construction site.  
It should contain realistic data as it would occur in practice.

Tierhotel is the manual testing construction site for edge cases.  
It tests the technical edge cases of both the app and the webpage.
