## About
baupen makes issue management on a construction site more pleasing and straight-forward.
It improves defect management, acceptance checks and documentation on the construction site.
It is developed to fulfil both the requirements of the construction site manager and the craftsman to work together easily and efficiently.

It suggests the following workflow:
 - the manager inspects the construction site, and notices incomplete or broken things, and creates an issue for each 
 - the manager returns to his office and registers the newly created issues (adds supplemental information & adds them to the issue register)
 - the manager sends an email to all craftsman which have new issues or have not responded yet to issues from the register assigned to them
 - the craftsman receives the email with a special link which displays all currently open issues to which he is assigned to
 - the craftsman visits the construction site and - using the received link - can resolve issues
 - the manager inspects the issues which the craftsman has resolved, and closes those which are completed to satisfaction
