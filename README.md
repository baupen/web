## About

Baupen makes issue management on construction sites more pleasing and straight-forward. It most notably improves defect management, acceptance checks and documentation. Both the requirements of the construction site manager and the craftsmen are fulfilled, to enable them work together transparently and efficiently.

It suggests the following workflow:
 - the construction manager creates issues for incomplete or wrongly executed tasks 
 - the construction manager supplements new issues (e.g. adds a deadline) and adds them to the issue register
 - the construction manager notifies craftsmen with new issues
 - the craftsman receives a personalised link with all currently open issues assigned to them
 - the craftsman executes the resulting tasks, and then marks the issues as resolved
 - the construction manager inspects the issues the craftsman resolved, and closes those which are completed to satisfaction

The first and the last step are best executed using the [iOS](https://github.com/baupen/iOS) or [Android](https://github.com/baupen/Android) apps.
